                  any hassle for searching house for rent because there are many
                  houses for rent but it's very tough for customers to searching
                  physically. So our service will help the people so that they
                  can find their desired house by searching in online. They
                  don't need to move here from there for searching only for
                  house. Also the owner of the house who want to rent their
                  house can post our website and then customer will book and
                  contact with them. So the service is more useful for both
